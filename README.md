# Modified **Akai Fire** script based on the one posted [here](https://forum.image-line.com/viewtopic.php?f=1994&t=228782)

This is just for fun project - use at your own risk!!!

It got more complicated than intended and I should make video later. Sorry about the confusion.



### New Features:
- When you are in performance mode, the grid can be split it sizes from 1 to 16 (the default) tracks
- Change split mode size with pressing Performance button or the Select/JogWheel knob and rotating it
- Text on the display indicates the current grid size when changing sizes
- It can work with any grid size, but keeping 16, 8 and 4 for now
- Mute track by pressing **Alt + Pad** on any clip of that track
- Trigger a scene/column by **Shift + Pad**
- Split range is displayed in the playlist selection grid



### Todo/Ideas/Issues:
- Alt + Mute - ?Mute all tracks on that row
- Shift + Mute - ?
- Alt + Shift + Pad - ?
- Alt + Shift + Mute - ?
- Key + Mute/Solo - Mute track
- Key + Mute/Solo - Mute all tracks in split mode
- Figure out what to do with overview mode
- Probably the rest of these ideas won't work because of API limitations
- Press record button while playing to dump the midi log into a pattern
- Key + Pad - Select clip
- Key + Pad - Stop clip
- Key + Pad - Remove clip
- Key + Pad - Put active sample/pattern into the clip's place
